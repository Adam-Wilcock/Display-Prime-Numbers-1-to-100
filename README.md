# Display-Prime-Numbers-1-to-100
This program will display all the prime numbers from 1 to 100
## Running the code
To clone and run my code, in command prompt, navigate to the file location that you wish to clone the repository to, you can do this by entering:
**cd c:/{your file location}**

Once you have done that, you can clone the repository in two ways:
In the repository you wish to clone on GitHub, navigate to the little green button that says "Code", once you are in that go to GitHub CLI and copy the text. 
It should look something like **"gh repo clone Adam-Wilcock/Display-Prime-Numbers-1-to-100"**
Paste that into command prompt and that should pull the repository from GItHub and put it into your folder
If the above does not work, try this method, type into command prompt **git clone {Page URL}.git**

There you go, that is how to clone my repository from GitHub to your own folder.
Once you have cloned my repository, to run it all you need to is navigate to the repository in your files and, locate the src folder and within it has all of my code including a python file, a visual studio file and a jupyter notebook.
### Running the Python File
To run the python file, select it, then click the file path (should be something like **This PC>Programs**) and click it so that all the text is highlighted.
Now type cmd and click enter. This will open command prompt in that file location. Now type the name of the python file including the file type into command prompt and this will run the python file.
### Running the Visual Studio Program
To run the visual studio program, open the folder called PrimeNumbers and double click the file called **PrimeNumbers.sln**. This will open the visual studio program, all you need to do now is click the start button at the top middle of your screen or press F5 on your keyboard.
### Running the Jupyter Notebook
To run the jupyter notebook, double click the file called **PrimeNumberDevelopmentNotebook.ipynb**, this will open visual studio code allowing you to view the jupyter notebook.
